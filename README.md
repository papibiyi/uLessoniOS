# uLessoniOS

#### STEP TO RUN PROJECT
* Used MVVM model as its cleaner and more straight foward
* Created all view programatically

### Improvements that could have been made 

Given more time i would have done the following:

* Saving recently watched using a database like realm/CoreData  instead of userdefaults
* Proper Caching of images instead of fetching them all the time
* Proper error messages and empty states when there is no internet connection
* Unit Testing
* Use of coordinator for navigation
